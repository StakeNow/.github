We support decentralization and thus the stability of distributed systems by promoting adaptation among private individuals and companies.

## Open Source projects

### Sign In With Tezos (SIWT)

Initiated: 2022-04-13

SIWT is an open-source library that supports the development of your decentralized application first of all by proving the ownership of the private key to the address the user signs in with. This allows you to add permissions to use an API/backend based on a diverse set of access-control mechanisms, like owning a specific NFT or an address being part of a white/black list. After winning the [Tezos x Encode hackathon](https://medium.com/encode-club/encode-x-tezos-hackathon-finale-prizewinners-and-summary-ba5c9cda677c) and due to the positive feedback from the Tezos community, we decided to spend additional efforts to take our Proof-of-Concept to an easy-to-integrate library with an extended feature set with the help of the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/). We invite you to use SIWT in your dApp and contact us in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6J3bjhkpxm?utm_source=StakeNow+Discord&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_campaign=StakeNow.Fi+Launch) if you have any questions!

### Tezos Reward Distributor (TRD)

Initiated: 2018-10-13

TRD is a software for distributing staking rewards of Tezos validators (bakers) occurred through the [Tezos Liquid Proof of Stake](https://tezos.com/governance/) consensus mechanism. It is not a script but a full scale application which can continuously run in the background as a Linux service. It can track cycles and make payments. However, it does not have to be used as a service, but it can also be used interactively. Read about it [here](https://tezos-reward-distributor-organization.github.io/tezos-reward-distributor/).
